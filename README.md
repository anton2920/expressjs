# Blog in Express.JS
## Description

This is a simple blog application. It allows you to create and view articles.

Articles are written with HTML and stored as JSON files in _blog/_ directory (I know it's far from optimal, but I since we're using JavaScript in the first place, why should I care?).

## Run

To run this application on your local machine:

```sh
% npm install cookie-parser express handlebars
% node main.js
```
